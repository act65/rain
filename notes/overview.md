### **Rain: A Reputation-Based Economy for a Connected and Disconnected World**

#### **1. Vision & Core Principle**

Rain's vision is to create a resilient, decentralized, and self-governing digital economy for communities where internet access is unreliable or unavailable.

The system is designed to solve the fundamental challenge of digital transactions in a disconnected environment. In an offline-first (Partition-Tolerant) world, it is technically impossible to prevent fraud like a double-spend at the moment of a transaction.

Therefore, Rain's core principle is to shift security from **technical prevention** to **economic incentive**. We cannot stop a bad actor from attempting fraud, but we can make it a catastrophically irrational decision. Rain achieves this through a novel, two-pronged approach: a detailed **online reputation score** for the connected world, and a simple, verifiable **offline reputation token** for when connectivity is a luxury.

#### **2. System Architecture: A Layered Approach**

Rain is built on four distinct layers, each serving a specific purpose.

*   **Layer 0: Decentralized Identity (DID)**
    *   **Implementation:** A user's identity is a private key, managed by their device's secure element. For now, users are responsible for their own key backup (e.g., via seed phrase).
    *   **Sybil Resistance:** New users are onboarded through a "Web of Trust," requiring a **co-staked reputation bond** from sponsors. This "skin-in-the-game" mechanism ensures sponsors are held accountable for the users they vouch for.
    *   **Technical Standard:** Identity and reputation are anchored to a non-transferable **Soulbound Token (SBT)**, creating a permanent, foundational identity.

*   **Layer 1: The Settlement Layer**
    *   **Implementation:** A low-cost, high-throughput blockchain (e.g., an Ethereum L2) that serves as the ultimate, immutable source of truth for all transactions and reputation scores.
    *   **Unit of Account:** A trusted, fiat-backed stablecoin (e.g., USDC).

*   **Layer 2: The Agreement Layer (Smart Contracts)**
    *   **Implementation:** A suite of smart contracts that function as the system's **impartial arbiter**, automatically enforcing the rules of the economy.
    *   **Key Contracts:**
        1.  **Reputation Contract:** Calculates and updates a user's reputation score, utilizing a network-aware algorithm inspired by **EigenTrust** to resist collusion and circular transaction attacks.
        2.  **Staking & Token Contract:** The engine of trust. This contract allows users to stake their online reputation score as collateral to mint **Offline Transaction Tokens**, secure loans, or act as escrow for commerce. It automatically slashes staked reputation in cases of proven fraud or default.
        3.  **Jury Contract:** Manages a decentralized justice system where jurors must **stake collateral to participate**. Jurors are rewarded for voting with the majority and slashed for being in the minority, creating a powerful incentive for honest adjudication.
        4.  **Treasury & Dividend Contract:** Holds system capital, earns yield from a diversified portfolio of secure protocols, and distributes it as a **Reputation Dividend** to users, giving the online score tangible, long-term value.

*   **Layer 3: The Application Layer (User-Facing App)**
    *   **Implementation:** An offline-first mobile application.
    *   **Features:**
        *   **Online Mode:** Functions as a standard crypto wallet, showing the user's full reputation score and transaction history.
        *   **Offline Transactions:** Uses QR codes to present and verify single-use Offline Transaction Tokens. The recipient's app only needs to validate the token's cryptographic signature.
        *   **"Sneakernet" Syncing:** Operates on a **dynamic fee market**. Users attach a small fee to their offline transactions, and syncing agents are incentivized to prioritize and settle the most profitable batches first, ensuring efficient and timely settlement.

#### **3. Key Mechanisms: The Dual Function of Reputation**

Rain's utility is built on two core functions of its hybrid reputation system.

**A. Reputation as a Valuable Asset (The Online Score)**

The online reputation score is a user's long-term measure of trustworthiness. Its value is driven by the **Reputation Dividend**. A higher score earns a user a larger, continuous stream of passive income from the system's treasury. A proven double-spend or major default results in the score being slashed to zero, permanently cutting the user off from this income and all other economic participation. This makes a user's reputation an asset they are highly motivated to protect.

**B. Reputation as Stakable Collateral (The Engine of Trust)**

This is the mechanism that converts long-term reputation into immediate, verifiable trust for specific interactions, both online and off. In all cases, a valuable, long-term asset (the online score) is used as collateral to guarantee a short-term promise.

*   **Use Case 1: Offline Transactions (The Token System)**
    *   **Flow:** A user with a high online score stakes a portion of it. The Staking Contract issues a signed, single-use Offline Transaction Token. The user presents this token to a merchant offline. The merchant's app verifies the signature and accepts the payment with confidence. The token is redeemed and settled during the next "Sneakernet" sync.

*   **Use Case 2: Decentralized Loans**
    *   **Flow:** A borrower stakes their reputation to secure a loan from a lender. This stake acts as collateral, which is slashed upon default, protecting the lender.

*   **Use Case 3: Commercial Escrow**
    *   **Flow:** A seller stakes reputation as a guarantee of product quality. The stake is frozen until the buyer confirms satisfaction, creating a self-policing marketplace.

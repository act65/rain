            // The new `increaseTransactionScore` and `decreaseTransactionScore` will *also* modify `reputationScores`.
            // This means `reputationScores` becomes the single, combined score.

            // Let's revert to the idea that `increaseTransactionScore` and `decreaseTransactionScore` directly modify `reputationScores`.

            // `_applyTransactionScoreToReputation` is called.
            // Inside `_applyTransactionScoreToReputation`, we decide how `transactionScores` affects `reputationScores`.

            // This function will be called after transactionScores[user] is updated.

            // This could mean that the *existing* functions are modified, or that new functions influence them.
            // The current structure of adding new `increase/decreaseTransactionScore` seems more aligned.

            // Let's assume `reputationScores` should reflect the sum of base reputation + transaction-derived reputation.
            // This is complex to maintain with separate functions.

            // Alternative: `ReputationV2` overrides `increaseReputation` and `decreaseReputation`.
            // This seems cleaner. However, the prompt has `increaseTransactionScore` and `decreaseTransactionScore`.

            // Let's stick to the current structure and make `_applyTransactionScoreToReputation` simple.
            // It will calculate a target reputation based on current base and current transaction score.
            // This is still not quite right.

            // Let's assume the `amount` in `increaseTransactionScore` is a raw positive event value (e.g., loan repaid on time value).
            // And `transactionScores` accumulates these.
            // The `reputationScores` should then be a function of this accumulated `transactionScores`.
            // This is what EigenTrust would do - recalculate.

            // Simplest placeholder for now:
            // `increaseTransactionScore` adds to `transactionScores` and then calls `_increaseReputationFromTx`.
            // `decreaseTransactionScore` subtracts from `transactionScores` and then calls `_decreaseReputationFromTx`.

            // It's called when transaction score changes. It adjusts `reputationScores`.
            // Let `delta` be the change in transaction score.
            // `reputationScores[user] += delta` (if delta is positive and causes increase)
            // `reputationScores[user] -= abs(delta)` (if delta is negative and causes decrease)

            // The current code:
            // `increaseTransactionScore(user, amount)` -> `transactionScores[user] += amount; _applyTransactionScoreToReputation(user);`
            // `_applyTransactionScoreToReputation(user)`:

            //    `currentTransactionScore = transactionScores[user]`
            //    This doesn't know the `amount` (delta) directly.

            // This means `_applyTransactionScoreToReputation` must work with the *total current* transaction score.
            // This is not incremental. This is a full recalculation based on the transaction score.
            // This is too complex for a placeholder.

            // Simplification: The `amount` in `increase/decreaseTransactionScore` IS the reputation change.
            // `transactionScores` map is just for tracking the "reason" or "component" of the score.
            // The `reputationScores` map remains the single source of truth.

            // And `decreaseTransactionScore` will call `super.decreaseReputation`.
            // The `transactionScores` map will be updated just for data/event logging.

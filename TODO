- move all constants in the contracts to a config file
- reorganise contracts into 'core' and 'periphery' (maybe even a separate 'features' as well)
- understand tradeoffs of on/off chain for the calculation of reputation
- move Stablecoin choice to being a hparam instead of hardcoded to USDC
- is the current way reputation is calculate enough to avoid circular trading issues? (manipulating your reputation?) (tho the fee kinda solves this issue right?)
- double check that 
- should authorizeAction use available reputation or true reputation?
- could change dividends to be propto available reputation?

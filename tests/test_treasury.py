    # Temporarily make the treasury balance low for this specific cycle creation
    # This is a bit hacky. A better way would be to deploy a new treasury or have a withdraw function for tests.
    # For now, we'll create a new cycle with this small deposit if possible, assuming previous cycle claimed some.
    # Or, more simply, set a very small totalDividendAmount for the cycle creation if the contract allowed it.
    # The current createDividendCycle uses the entire balance.
    # So, the test needs to ensure the *entire* treasury balance is small enough.
    # This test is hard to isolate perfectly without a way to set exact cycle funds or withdraw.

    # Let's assume the main treasury fixture already has a large amount.
    # We will rely on user3_rep (1) * cycle_total_dividend being less than total_rep_snapshot.
    # If cycle_total_dividend (INITIAL_TREASURY_REVENUE = 500_000e18)
    # and total_rep_snapshot (approx 300e18).
    # (1 * 500000e18) / 300e18 = 1666. This is not zero.
    # The test logic is flawed if it expects a revert with "Calculated dividend is zero" with current numbers.

    # To force dividend to be zero: user_rep * total_dividend < total_rep_snapshot
    # Let user3_rep = 1. Let total_dividend_for_this_cycle = 200 (less than total_rep_snapshot of ~300e18)
    # This requires creating a cycle with a custom small amount.
    # The current `createDividendCycle` uses the whole treasury balance.
    # A better test: ensure user3 has 0 actual reputation (not just 1 wei).
    # However, the contract requires userReputation > 0 to even attempt calculation.
    # Let's change the test to ensure the revert happens, by setting up values correctly.

    # Re-evaluate: The contract has `require(dividendAmount > 0, "Calculated dividend is zero...")`
    # So if dividendAmount IS 0, it WILL revert.
    # We need `(userReputation * cycle.totalDividendAmount) / cycle.totalReputationSnapshot == 0`.
    # This means `userReputation * cycle.totalDividendAmount < cycle.totalReputationSnapshot`.
    # With user3_rep = 1, we need `cycle.totalDividendAmount < cycle.totalReputationSnapshot`.
    # `cycle.totalDividendAmount` is `INITIAL_TREASURY_REVENUE = 500_000 * 1e18`.
    # `total_rep_snapshot` is `(100+200)*1e18 + 1 = (300 * 1e18) + 1`.
    # Clearly `500_000e18` is NOT less than `300e18`. So dividend will NOT be zero.
    # The test's expectation of revert is wrong with these numbers.

    # The test should pass if the dividend is calculated as non-zero and the transaction goes through.
    # The revert message is for when the calculated dividend *would have been* zero, and thus no payout.
    # The current setup results in a non-zero dividend (1666 wei for user3). So claim should succeed.
    # The test is named "calculated_is_zero" but its setup does not make it zero.

    # Let's adjust the setup to make the dividend zero FOR REAL to test the revert.
    # We need a new cycle with a small amount.
    # For simplicity, let an admin set a small cycle amount if that were possible, or drain treasury.
    # Since we can't easily drain, let's use a very large totalReputationSnapshot for this test.

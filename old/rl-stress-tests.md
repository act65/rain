### **Objective: To Test the Economic Security and Stability of the Rain Protocol**

The goal of these experiments is to create a simulated environment (an "economic petri dish") populated by self-interested AI agents and observe whether the protocol's incentive structures are sufficient to prevent collapse and encourage cooperation, even under adversarial conditions.

### **The Simulated Environment: The "Game"**

This is a software model of your protocol's core smart contracts:
1.  **Reputation Contract:** Calculates reputation based on transaction history.
2.  **Staking & Token Contract:** Issues Offline Tokens against staked reputation. Slashes stake on proven default.
3.  **The Rainfall Pool:** A lending pool where agents can lend or borrow USDC. The interest rate is dynamic based on supply and demand (utilization).
4.  **Jury Contract:** Allows agents to stake capital to adjudicate disputes.
5.  **Treasury & Dividend Contract:** Distributes a Reputation Dividend.

### **The Agents: The "Players"**

These are the RL bots, each programmed with a different goal (a "reward function").

*   **Honest Users (`Homo Economicus`):** Their goal is to maximize their long-term wealth. They transact, pay back their credit to grow their reputation, and collect the Reputation Dividend.
*   **Lenders (`Capital Providers`):** Their goal is to maximize the yield on their USDC. They will deposit capital into the Rainfall Pool when rates are attractive and withdraw it when they perceive risk to be too high.
*   **Rational Attackers (`Fraudsters`):** Their goal is to maximize immediate, extractive profit. They will attempt to double-spend or default if, and only if, the projected profit from the theft is greater than the Net Present Value (NPV) of the reputation they would forfeit.
*   **Sybil Army (`Colluders`):** A single entity controlling a large number of low-reputation agents. Their goal is to maximize the army's collective profit, potentially by scaling small attacks or manipulating governance/juries.

### **The RL Experiments: Key Scenarios to Model**

Here are the specific experiments to run, each targeting a risk we discussed.

#### **Experiment 1: The Double-Spend Attack & Reputation Value**
*   **Question:** Under what conditions does it become rational for a user to default on their offline credit?
*   **Setup:** Initialize the system with a population of Honest Users and Lenders. Introduce a single Rational Attacker agent.
*   **Simulation:** The Attacker participates honestly for a while to build up a reputation score. They then request the maximum Offline Credit Limit (`L`) allowed by their stake. The RL agent's core decision is then: "Do I sync and repay my debt, or do I default?"
*   **What to Test:** Run simulations where you vary the key parameters that determine the *cost* of the attack:
    *   **Vary the Reputation Dividend:** How valuable must the future income stream be to deter the attack?
    *   **Vary the Collateralization Ratio (`f`):** How much more valuable must the staked reputation be than the credit limit (`L`) to ensure honesty?
*   **Success Condition:** The Attacker agent overwhelmingly "chooses" not to default because the reward function shows that the long-term loss of the Reputation Dividend outweighs the short-term gain of stealing `L`.

#### **Experiment 2: The Sybil Attack & The Vouching Stake**
*   **Question:** Is the Vouching Stake sufficient to make a Sybil attack unprofitable?
*   **Setup:** Start the system with your proposed "genesis accounts" (creator-controlled high-reputation users). Introduce a Sybil Army agent that controls a sponsor and a new recruit.
*   **Simulation:** The Sybil sponsor pays the Vouching Stake to onboard the new Sybil recruit. The recruit is then granted a small, new-user credit limit. The recruit defaults.
*   **What to Test:** Directly model the "Net-Negative Identity Postulate."
    *   `Profit = New_User_Credit_Limit`
    *   `Cost = Value_of_Vouching_Stake` (slashed from the sponsor)
*   **Success Condition:** The simulation confirms that `Cost > Profit`, making it economically irrational to scale this attack. The Sybil Army agent learns that creating new identities to defraud the system is a money-losing strategy.

#### **Experiment 3: The Rainfall Pool "Bank Run"**
*   **Question:** Is the market-based credit system resilient to shocks in lender confidence?
*   **Setup:** Populate the Rainfall Pool with a large number of Lender agents. Allow the system to reach a stable equilibrium of lending and borrowing.
*   **Simulation:** Introduce an external shock. For example, suddenly have a few large, public defaults occur (from Experiment 1). This should cause the Lender agents to update their risk assessment.
*   **What to Test:** Observe the Lenders' behavior. Do they begin to withdraw capital en masse? If so, how does the system respond?
*   **Success Condition:** As capital is withdrawn, the pool's utilization rate skyrockets, causing the interest rate to spike. This dramatically increases the cost of borrowing, which in turn reduces demand for new credit. The system should find a new, stable (though smaller) equilibrium, successfully weathering the shock without collapsing.

#### **Experiment 4: Jury Manipulation**
*   **Question:** How much capital is required to successfully manipulate the justice system?
*   **Setup:** Create a subjective dispute that requires a jury vote. Populate the jury pool with a mix of Honest Users and a Sybil Army.
*   **Simulation:** All potential jurors must stake capital to participate. The Sybil Army attempts to control the outcome by having all its members stake and vote together.
*   **What to Test:** Calculate the total value of the stake the Sybil Army must risk to guarantee it forms a majority of the voting power on the jury.
*   **Success Condition:** The cost to guarantee a majority is prohibitively high, making the attack economically infeasible for all but the most high-value disputes. This demonstrates that the jury is resistant to manipulation.

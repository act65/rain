- move all constants in the contracts to a config file
- move Stablecoin choice to being a hparam instead of hardcoded to USDC
- add conditionaltransfer, conditionalpromise, ... to support options (these would make our system economically 'complete'?)
- how are delayed bandits related to promises?
- move core code utils from py scripts into a python lib.
- support multi-party contracts!?
- can now simplify Calculus engine? (don't need monitored action, it's only promises which trigger the fee?)
- docker deployment (our scripts will need to be deployed separately?)
- add partialrepayment and stkaed-marketplace contracts
